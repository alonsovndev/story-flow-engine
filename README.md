# Story Flow Engine

A CLI tool that transforms structured Markdown files into Jira issues. Write your epics and user stories once in Markdown, push them to Jira automatically.

![story-cli-home](./docs/images/story-cli-preview.png)

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
git clone <repo-url> && cd story-flow-engine
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env    # edit with your Jira credentials
./scripts/run-cli
```

## ✨ Features

- **Markdown Parsing** — Parse structured epic and user story templates
- **Jira Integration** — Create and fetch issues via REST API
- **Hierarchical Support** — Manage Epic → Stories relationships
- **Interactive CLI** — Menu-driven interface with InquirerPy, or direct commands for scripting
- **Clean Architecture** — Domain-Driven Design with clear separation of concerns

## 💻 Usage

### Interactive Menu

```bash
./scripts/run-cli
# or
python -m src.app.presentation.cli
```

Three options available:

1. **Retrieve an epic** — Fetch epic details from Jira by key (e.g., `PROJ-123`)
2. **Create a new epic** — Parse a Markdown file and create the epic in Jira
3. **Exit**

### Direct Commands (for scripts / CI)

The CLI also supports argument-based invocation:

```bash
# Fetch an epic by Jira key
python -m src.app.presentation.cli fetch-epic PROJ-123

# Create an epic from a markdown file
python -m src.app.presentation.cli create-epic data/EPIC-0-foundational/epic.md
```

## 📝 Markdown Format

Place epics and stories under `data/EPIC-N-description/` with `epic.md` and `stories.md` files.

### Epics

```markdown
# Epic: My Feature

**Epic Title**: My Feature
**Epic Key**: EPIC-1
**Summary**: Short description of the epic
**Labels**: frontend, api
**Priority**: Must Have

---

**Epic Description:**
Detailed description here...
```

### User Stories

```markdown
# Story: User Authentication

**Story Title**: User Authentication
**Story Key**: STORY-1
**As a** visitor
**I want** to sign in securely
**So that** I can access my private dashboard
**Labels**: backend, auth
**Priority**: Should Have
**Story Points**: 5

---

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- User can sign in with email and password
- Invalid credentials return a clear error message
- Session remains active until logout
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

├── config/                      # YAML-based configuration
├── core/domain/                 # Shared kernel: issue abstractions, value objects, exceptions

│   └── story/                   # Story slice: entity, port, DTOs/mapper, Jira adapter
├── infrastructure/
│   └── external/jira/           # Shared Jira support (settings, datetime parsing)
├── presentation/                # Typer CLI shell + InquirerPy menus
└── shared/                      # Cross-cutting utilities
    ├── logging.py               # Structured logger (JSON or plain text)
    └── utils/                   # Retry decorator
```

The project follows **Clean Architecture** with **Domain-Driven Design**, organized as vertical feature slices. Each feature (`epic`, `story`) owns its domain, application (use cases, ports, DTOs), and infrastructure layers; features collaborate only through each other's public ports and DTOs. Entities use factory methods, value objects are immutable, and the application layer depends only on abstractions, not concrete implementations.

## 🛠️ Development

```bash
pytest                  # run all tests
pytest --cov=src        # with coverage
pytest tests/unit/features/epic/domain/   # specific path
```

- **Style**: PEP 8, Google-style docstrings, full type hints
- **Naming**: camelCase variables, PascalCase classes
